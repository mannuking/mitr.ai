## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to develop a sophisticated, emotionally intelligent chatbot capable of providing personalized mental health support. The chatbot will leverage **multimodal input** – text, voice, and facial expressions – to understand user emotions and needs more comprehensively than traditional text-based chatbots.  The system will incorporate **deep learning models** for emotion recognition and **advanced conversational AI** to create empathetic and adaptable interactions, offering varying levels of support ranging from casual conversation to clinical information and referral guidance.
